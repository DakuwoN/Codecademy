# Create a Playlist App With the Spotify API (Part One)

This project will give you hands-on practice using an API to create an interactive React application. It emphasizes the significance of displaying data effectively while also highlighting the importance of fetching data from APIs. By completing this project, you will gain an understanding of how to create modular, scalable, and efficient applications using React.

In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

Features:

- Users can search for songs by song title.
- You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
